# Student Performance Analysis Project 🎓

This repository contains a full-cycle data analysis project focused on identifying factors that contribute to student academic success in Mathematics.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `data/`: Directory containing the student dataset (CSV).
* `main.py`: The primary Python script containing the analysis pipeline.
* `README.md`: Project documentation and setup instructions.

📊 Key Insights from AnalysisStudy Correlation: There is a strong positive correlation ($r \approx 0.82$) between study hours and math scores.The Sleep Gap: Students who averaged 8 hours of sleep scored significantly higher than those with less than 6, even if study hours were equal.Parental Influence: Students whose parents have a Master's degree showed a higher median score ($+15\%$) compared to the "High School" baseline group.🛠️ Built WithPandas - Data manipulation and cleaning.Matplotlib - Core visualization.Seaborn - Statistical data visualization.Numpy - Numerical operations.
